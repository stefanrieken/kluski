# Variable number of args is supported for '+'
printnum (+ 1 2 3 4);

# Being a fixed function call (for demonstration purposes), the same thing doesn't work for '*';
# the evaluation function just assumes two arguments.
# Also: if expression exceeds the number of required arg or return value registers, an error is produced.
# (Stack is not yet used for anything.)
printnum (* 2 3 4);

# This is half of 42:
printnum (eval { * (+ 1 2) (+ 3 4) });

# And this is all of it:
eval { printnum (+ (* 3 4) (* 5 6)) };
